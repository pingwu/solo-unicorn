# Phase 02: DISTORT

**Transform How You See Your Experience**

---

## The Principle

Distortion is the second operation in the **Delete / Distort / Generalize** framework. After stripping away what is no longer true, you transform what remains. You look at your experience through a different lens -- your audience's lens -- and discover that the skills you thought were liabilities are assets waiting to be reframed.

In the novel, David Lin meets three people who each distort his self-understanding in a different way:

- **Chen**, a hypnotist, shows David that his feelings of insufficiency are a pattern, not a fact -- and that his immigrant experience of translating between worlds is his greatest professional asset, not a liability to overcome.
- **Jenny**, a debate champion turned IP attorney, forces David to stop building in isolation and start listening to what people actually need.
- **Andreas**, a multilingual professor, teaches David that clarity beats explanation -- and that the gap between human cognition and machine intelligence is a translation problem, not a technology problem.

Phase 02 walks you through the same transformation. You will shift from looking inward ("what do I know?") to looking outward ("what do they need?").

## Lessons in This Phase

| # | Lesson | Key Question | Deliverable |
|---|--------|-------------|-------------|
| 4 | [Read the Room](lesson-read-the-room.md) | What patterns can I see that my audience cannot? | Audience pain points map |
| 5 | [Package Value](lesson-package-value.md) | How does my expertise overlap with their need? | Three value propositions |
| 6 | [The Translation Gap](lesson-translation-gap.md) | What bridge am I uniquely positioned to build? | Positioning statement |

## What You Will Transform

By the end of this phase, you will have:

- **Mapped your audience's pain points** -- not what you assume they need, but what they actually struggle with
- **Identified the overlap** between your skills and their needs -- the Venn diagram that defines your business
- **Written a positioning statement** that describes the gap you fill in language your audience would use

## How Distortion Works

In human cognition, distortion is how we transform raw perception into meaning. We bend experiences to fit our existing models. Sometimes this is useful -- a metaphor that makes a complex idea accessible. Sometimes it is harmful -- an assumption that "they would never hire someone like me" that prevents you from asking.

In large language models, distortion happens through the transformation layers. A word like "bank" enters the model as one representation and is bent through high-dimensional space until it means something entirely different depending on context -- "river bank" versus "bank account." The model distorts the input to extract meaning.

This phase trains you to **distort intentionally** -- to take your experience and reshape it through the lens of your audience's needs.
