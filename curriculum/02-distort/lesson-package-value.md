# Lesson: Package Value

**From Scattered Expertise to Product**

## Opening Excerpt

> Jenny Huang arrived twenty minutes late to the coffee shop on Castro Street, which David would later learn was not lateness but strategy. She used the walk from her car to scan the room, read the person she was meeting, and decide how to open. By the time she sat down across from him, she already knew three things about David Lin that he hadn't told her.
>
> "You've been sitting here rehearsing what to say to me," she said, dropping a worn leather folio onto the table. "Stop."

*From "Just Ask" by Pinghsien Wu, Chapter 5*

Jenny -- a former national debate champion turned IP attorney -- delivers the bluntest lesson of the novel: **stop sitting in your garage trying to figure it out. Go talk to people. Ask.**

## The Concept: The Venn Diagram

Jenny draws it on a napkin. Two overlapping circles. Left circle: *Your skills*. Right circle: *Their pain*. In the overlap, a single word: *Business*.

> "Your business lives here. Not on the left. Not on the right. In the middle, where what you can do meets what they can't stand living with anymore. But you can only find the overlap by asking. You cannot think your way to it from your garage."

*From "Just Ask" by Pinghsien Wu, Chapter 5*

David has spent eighteen months filling the left circle -- frameworks, methodologies, pricing tiers. The right circle is empty. He has never talked to a single person who might pay him.

> "A product nobody asked for isn't a product. It's inventory. Depreciating on a shelf while you convince yourself that more polish is what's missing. What's missing isn't polish. What's missing is a conversation."

*From "Just Ask" by Pinghsien Wu, Chapter 5*

Jenny also introduces the concept that reframes David's entire approach -- **finite vs. infinite games**:

> "Finite games are played to win. They have rules, boundaries, an endpoint. You win, or you don't, and then the game is over and you start from zero."
>
> "Infinite games are played to continue. No fixed rules, no endpoint. You play to keep playing. Every conversation leads to the next one. Every relationship compounds."

*From "Just Ask" by Pinghsien Wu, Chapter 5*

Your landing page is not a finite game (win the click, get the conversion, done). It is the beginning of an infinite game -- a conversation that compounds.

## The Writitation Exercise

### Observe (What is the current state?)

Draw Jenny's napkin. Two circles, overlapping.

**Left circle -- Your Skills:** List everything you bring. Technical skills, domain knowledge, soft skills, life experience, cross-domain perspectives. Do not filter. Do not judge whether something is "marketable." Just list.

**Right circle -- Their Pain:** Using your audience pain points map from the previous lesson, list what your audience is struggling with. Use their words, not yours.

### Discern (What is the desired state?)

Look at the overlap. Where does your skill directly address their pain? These intersections are your **value propositions**.

Write three value propositions, each following this format:

> **"I help [specific audience] [achieve specific outcome] by [your unique approach], so they can [tangible result]."**

Rules:
- Each must address a pain point from the right circle
- Each must use a skill from the left circle
- Each must describe an outcome the audience would recognize and want
- None should mention your tools or methodology -- only results

Example: *"I help overwhelmed marketing directors create AI strategies their CEO can actually approve by translating technical capabilities into business decisions, so they stop spending budget on tools nobody uses."*

### Validate with a Question

For each value proposition, write the question that would test it:

> **"If someone could [the outcome you promise], would that be worth paying for? What would you expect it to cost?"**

These are the questions Jenny would ask. Not hypothetical. Direct. About money. If the question makes you uncomfortable, that is the lemon juice talking -- the belief that more polish will substitute for a conversation.

## Deliverable

**Three value propositions** that describe the overlap between your skills and your audience's pain.

Write them in your incubator journal. Rank them by which one you are most confident about -- and note which ones you have validated with a real person versus which ones are still assumptions.

---

## Key Takeaway

> "Nobody's paying you to solve your problem, David. They'll pay you to solve theirs."

*From "Just Ask" by Pinghsien Wu, Chapter 5*

Jenny's sentence is the hinge of the novel and of this curriculum. The left circle is about you. The right circle is about them. Your landing page lives in the overlap -- and the overlap can only be found by asking.
