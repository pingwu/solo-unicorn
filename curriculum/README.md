# Unicorn Incubator Curriculum

**From Idea to Landing Page: A Guided Journey Through the "Just Ask" Framework**

This curriculum transforms your expertise into a live, deployed landing page. It follows the **Delete / Distort / Generalize** framework from *Just Ask* by Pinghsien Wu -- the same cognitive architecture that powers both human insight and large language models.

Each lesson pairs an excerpt from the novel with a hands-on exercise. Lesson by lesson, your deliverables chain together into a complete **content brief** -- the raw material for your landing page. Then Phase 04 walks you through building and deploying it.

## How to Use This Curriculum

1. **Work sequentially.** Each deliverable feeds the next lesson.
2. **Use the Writitation practice.** Every lesson includes a writing exercise based on the Observe / Discern / Validate framework. Write before you edit. Capture before you judge.
3. **Bring your own expertise.** The novel follows David Lin, a mid-career technologist. Your domain will be different. The framework transfers.
4. **Ship early.** Phase 04 turns your content brief into a live page. Imperfect and deployed beats perfect and imagined.

## The Framework

The curriculum is built on the **Delete / Distort / Generalize** model -- three operations that both human cognition and large language models use to process information:

- **DELETE** -- Strip away expired assumptions, invisible biases, and the "lemon juice" strategies that feel productive but aren't.
- **DISTORT** -- Transform your perspective. See your experience through your audience's eyes. Repackage what you know as what they need.
- **GENERALIZE** -- Extract transferable patterns. Build systems -- a headline, content sections, a complete brief -- from the specific insights you uncovered.

This is the same architecture described in Chomsky's transformational grammar, the NLP Meta Model, and the attention mechanisms inside transformer-based AI. The novel weaves all three threads together. The curriculum puts them to work.
