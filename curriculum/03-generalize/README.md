# Phase 03: GENERALIZE

**Build Systems from What You Discovered**

---

## The Principle

Generalization is the third operation in the **Delete / Distort / Generalize** framework. After deleting what is no longer true and distorting your perspective through your audience's eyes, you now extract transferable patterns and build systems from them.

In the novel, David Lin's generalization phase transforms him from a cloud engineer (specific, bounded, expiring) into a bridge builder (general, transferable, compounding). He stops preparing fifty-slide decks and starts asking one question. He stops performing expertise and starts creating.

> "I used to be a cloud engineer. Specific skills. Specific shelf life. I am now a bridge builder. Someone who translates between domains that don't speak each other's language. That's not a job title. It's a generalization. And generalizations transfer."

*From "Just Ask" by Pinghsien Wu, Chapter 9*

Phase 03 turns your insights from Phases 01 and 02 into the concrete building blocks of a landing page: a hero headline, content sections, and a complete content brief.

## Lessons in This Phase

| # | Lesson | Key Question | Deliverable |
|---|--------|-------------|-------------|
| 7 | [One Slide](lesson-one-slide.md) | What is the one question my audience needs answered? | Hero headline + CTA |
| 8 | [Delivery](lesson-delivery.md) | How do I turn my understanding into sections that serve the reader? | Content sections draft |
| 9 | [Just Ask](lesson-just-ask.md) | Is my content brief honest and complete? | Complete content brief |

## What You Will Build

By the end of this phase, you will have:

- A **hero headline and call-to-action** that captures your positioning in one line
- **Content sections** that walk your audience from recognition ("this is my problem") to action ("I want this solution")
- A **complete content brief** that is ready to become a landing page in Phase 04

## How Generalization Works

In human cognition, generalization is how we build transferable knowledge. We take specific experiences and extract patterns: "The last three times I did X, Y happened -- so Y probably follows X." This is how expertise develops -- and how it becomes portable across domains.

In large language models, generalization happens when the model learns patterns from training data that apply to new inputs it has never seen. The model does not memorize every sentence. It learns the underlying structure that generates sentences.

This phase trains you to **generalize your discoveries** -- to take the specific insights from your Writitation exercises and build them into structures that serve your audience.
