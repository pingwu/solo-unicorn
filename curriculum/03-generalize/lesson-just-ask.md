# Lesson: Just Ask

**The Skill Behind Every Breakthrough**

*Novel Reference: "Just Ask" by Pinghsien Wu, Chapter 9*

---

## Opening Excerpt

> "Two years ago," he said, "I ended my own career with a single click."
>
> He told it simply. No buildup.
>
> "I was a Director of Cloud Operations. I'd spent three months building a cost-optimization analysis for our CTO. Fifty slides. I rehearsed until my wife started quoting my transitions at dinner."

*From "Just Ask" by Pinghsien Wu, Chapter 9*

David returns to the GenAI Summit -- as the closing keynote speaker. In front of twelve hundred people, he tells the story of the close button, the eighteen months of lemon juice, and the four teachers who each gave him a better question instead of an answer.

His conclusion:

> "The skill behind every AI breakthrough is the same skill behind every human breakthrough. It's the ability to ask the right question. Not the clever question. Not the one that makes you look smart. The right question is the one you've been deleting from awareness because the answer might require you to change."

*From "Just Ask" by Pinghsien Wu, Chapter 9*

## The Concept: The Honest Question

The novel ends where it began -- with a click. But the meaning has changed. The first click was accidental: Close instead of Share. The second click is deliberate: David closes his laptop and lets the question exist without rushing to answer it.

> "All conditioned phenomena are like dreams, illusions, bubbles, shadows. Like dew and like lightning."
>
> His fifty-slide decks. His corner office. His titles. Conditioned phenomena. Not permanent. Not even particularly real. Just forms that had accumulated around a question he'd never asked.

*From "Just Ask" by Pinghsien Wu, Chapter 9*

Your landing page is a conditioned phenomenon. It will change. It will evolve. The version you deploy in Phase 04 will not be the version that exists in six months. That is fine. What matters is not the page. What matters is the question underneath it.

The honest question your landing page answers -- the one from your problem statement, refined through six lessons of Writitation -- is the thing that lasts.

David names what he is building:

> *Professional Institute of Next Gen. PING.* His own name in Chinese, hidden in plain sight. The way the best things are.

*From "Just Ask" by Pinghsien Wu, Chapter 9*

## The Writitation Exercise: Capstone

This is the final Writitation before you build. It integrates everything.

### Observe (What is the current state?)

Gather all your deliverables:

1. List of expired assumptions (Lesson 1)
2. Your identified lemon juice (Lesson 2)
3. One-sentence problem statement (Lesson 3)
4. Audience pain points map (Lesson 4)
5. Three value propositions (Lesson 5)
6. Positioning statement (Lesson 6)
7. Hero headline + CTA (Lesson 7)
8. Content sections draft (Lesson 8)

Read them all. Then write for twenty minutes:

> **Looking at everything I have written, what is the honest question my landing page is answering? Not the marketing version. The version I would say to a friend at midnight, without any polish.**

### Discern (What is the desired state?)

Assemble your **complete content brief**. This is the document you will hand to Phase 04 to build your landing page.

**Content Brief Template:**

```
LANDING PAGE CONTENT BRIEF
===========================

1. POSITIONING STATEMENT
   [From Lesson 6]

2. TARGET AUDIENCE
   Who: [specific description]
   Their main pain point: [from pain points map]
   What they have tried: [from pain points map]
   What is missing: [the gap you fill]

3. HERO SECTION
   Headline: [from Lesson 7]
   Subheadline: [from Lesson 7]
   CTA: [from Lesson 7]

4. VALUE PROPOSITIONS
   1. [from Lesson 5]
   2. [from Lesson 5]
   3. [from Lesson 5]

5. CONTENT SECTIONS
   [from Lesson 8 -- each section with heading and body]

6. FINAL CTA
   Headline: [restated or evolved from hero CTA]
   CTA button text: [specific action]

7. PROOF / CREDIBILITY
   [Any testimonials, case studies, credentials, or
   social proof you can include. If none yet, note
   "To be added after first customers."]

8. THE HONEST QUESTION
   [The midnight version -- what this page is really about]
```

### Validate with a Question

Before moving to Phase 04, answer one final question:

> **"If my ideal audience member read this content brief from top to bottom, would they feel that someone finally understood their problem -- and had a clear, credible path to solving it?"**

If yes, you are ready to build.

If no, identify which section feels weak and revisit the corresponding lesson.

## Deliverable

**A complete content brief** -- the assembled document containing all deliverables from Lessons 1-8, structured and ready for implementation.

This brief is the input for Phase 04, where you will turn it into a live, deployed landing page using the Agentic Landing Template.

## Key Takeaway

> "You are not your job. You are not your tools. You are not your fifty-slide deck. You are the question you're brave enough to ask."

*From "Just Ask" by Pinghsien Wu, Chapter 9*

The curriculum has taken you through the same arc David traveled: Delete what is no longer true. Distort your perspective through your audience's eyes. Generalize your insights into something the world can use.

What you have now is not a landing page. It is something more valuable: **clarity about who you serve, what gap you fill, and why it matters**. The landing page is just the container. The clarity is the content.

Now build it.
