# Lesson: One Slide, One Question

**From Fifty Slides to One Question**

*Novel Reference: "Just Ask" by Pinghsien Wu, Chapter 7*

## Opening Excerpt

> By slide 5, Raj's phone was face-up, Slack notifications glowing. By slide 8, Sandra's pen had stopped moving. By slide 12, Tom interrupted.
>
> "How many more slides?"
>
> "Through fifty."
>
> Tom leaned back. "We've been through three consultants. Every one came in with a version of this. Beautiful deck. Great data. Then a six-month roadmap like every other six-month roadmap."

*From "Just Ask" by Pinghsien Wu, Chapter 7*

David's first enterprise opportunity. He has prepared fifty slides -- Gartner data, McKinsey benchmarks, ROI projections in three scenarios. It bombs. The CTO checks his phone after slide twelve.

Then David does the hardest thing: he unplugs the HDMI cable and asks a single question.

> "What's the one decision you keep postponing because you don't have enough information?"
>
> The CTO talks for forty minutes. David listens, maps the problem, proposes a thirty-day pilot. His first enterprise engagement. One slide. One question.

*From "Just Ask" by Pinghsien Wu, Chapter 7*

## The Concept: Clarity Over Volume

A landing page is not a fifty-slide deck. It is one slide. One question. One clear statement that makes the right person stop scrolling and say, "This is for me."

Everything you have built in Phases 01 and 02 -- the expired assumptions, the identified lemon juice, the problem statement, the audience pain points, the value propositions, the positioning statement -- converges here. Into a headline and a call-to-action.

The chapter also shows how David's first paid role came not from a pitch but from a relationship. Yi-Te, the community elder, needed help structuring his memoir. David helped -- not with a framework, but by asking questions and feeding Yi-Te's documented history into AI tools to surface patterns Yi-Te could not see from inside his own story.

> "This is how it works, A-Xien. Not resumes. Not LinkedIn. Relationships."

*From "Just Ask" by Pinghsien Wu, Chapter 7*

Your landing page creates that first relationship at scale. The headline is the question. The CTA is the door.

## The Writitation Exercise

### Observe (What is the current state?)

Gather your deliverables from the previous lessons:
- Your expired assumptions (Lesson 1)
- Your identified lemon juice (Lesson 2)
- Your one-sentence problem statement (Lesson 3)
- Your audience pain points map (Lesson 4)
- Your three value propositions (Lesson 5)
- Your positioning statement (Lesson 6)

Read them all in sequence. Then write for ten minutes:

> **If I could say one sentence to my ideal audience member -- the person scrolling past a hundred websites who needs exactly what I offer -- what would stop them?**

Do not write a tagline. Write the honest sentence. The one that names their pain so precisely they feel seen.

### Discern (What is the desired state?)

Shape that sentence into a **hero headline**. This is the first thing a visitor sees on your landing page. It must:

- Name the audience's problem or desired outcome (not your solution)
- Use their language (not industry jargon)
- Be short enough to read in under three seconds

Then write a **call-to-action (CTA)** -- the button text or link that tells the visitor what to do next.

The CTA should:
- Be specific ("Get the free guide" not "Submit")
- Promise a next step, not a commitment
- Match the headline's promise

**Format:**

> **Headline:** [Your headline here]
>
> **Subheadline:** [One sentence that expands on the headline]
>
> **CTA:** [Button text]

Example:
> **Headline:** Your AI budget is growing. Your clarity isn't.
>
> **Subheadline:** A 30-day process for turning AI confusion into a strategy your team can actually execute.
>
> **CTA:** Start the 30-day clarity sprint

### Validate with a Question

Show your headline to three people who fit your target audience. Ask:

> **"If you saw this headline, would you want to know more? What would you expect to find on the page?"**

Their answer tells you whether the headline lands -- and whether their expectations match what you are building.

## Deliverable

**A hero headline and call-to-action** for your landing page.

Write them in your incubator journal. They will become the top of your content brief in Lesson 9.

Remember: David's fifty-slide deck bombed. His one question closed the deal. Your headline is that one question -- addressed to an audience of strangers.

## Key Takeaway

> "Fifty slides was a wall. One question was a door."
