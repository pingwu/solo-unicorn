# Lesson: Delivery

**The Highest Understanding**

## Opening Excerpt

> "Good evening. My name is David Lin. I spent twenty years in cloud infrastructure and technology acquisitions. I got laid off because my company decided AI could do my job faster and cheaper. They were partly right. I'm here because of what they got wrong."

*From "Just Ask" by Pinghsien Wu, Chapter 8*

David begins teaching at GSTU -- a university course for mid-career professionals who mirror his own journey: stuck, overwhelmed, technically competent, strategically lost. His morning writing practice becomes a teaching tool. A student names it: "That's not journaling. That's Writitation -- you're meditating by writing."

The classroom scene produces the curriculum's core framework when a student -- Patricia, VP of Marketing -- naturally walks through three steps without being taught them:

> **1. Observe what is.** -- She mapped her team's actual workflow and discovered undocumented capabilities.
>
> **2. Discern the desired state.** -- She identified a new capability: predicting campaign performance before launch.
>
> **3. Validate with a question.** -- She asked her CEO: "What decision would you make differently if you could predict campaign performance before launch?" The real conversation started.

## The Concept: Content as Service

David maps the Writitation framework to three landmark AI research papers, showing that the smartest researchers and a VP of Marketing in his classroom arrived at the same process:

| Writitation Step | AI Research Parallel |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| **Observe what is** | *Attention Is All You Need* -- stop processing everything; focus on what matters |
| **Discern the desired state** | *Retrieval-Augmented Generation* -- combine what you know with what you go find |
| **Validate with a question** | *Scaling Laws* -- you learn more from deploying than from planning |

Your landing page content sections follow the same architecture. Each section should:

1. **Observe** -- Name what the visitor is experiencing (their current state)
2. **Discern** -- Show them the desired state (what becomes possible)
3. **Validate** -- Give them a reason to act (evidence, testimonial, or a question that resonates)

The chapter's key insight about delivery:

> "Cutting costs with AI is easy. Everyone can do that. Everyone *is* doing that. But creating new revenue, new services, new possibilities? That requires creativity. That requires asking questions nobody's asked yet."

*From "Just Ask" by Pinghsien Wu, Chapter 8*

Your content sections are not a product description. They are a guided conversation that helps your visitor discover what they actually need.

## The Writitation Exercise

### Observe (What is the current state?)

Your landing page needs content sections between the hero headline and the final CTA. Each section should address a different aspect of your audience's journey.

Write for fifteen minutes:

> **What does my audience need to believe before they will take action? What objections, fears, or misconceptions stand between their current state and clicking the CTA?**

Common barriers:
- "I've tried something like this before and it didn't work" (need: differentiation)
- "I don't have time for another initiative" (need: simplicity)
- "How do I know this will work for my situation?" (need: specificity or proof)
- "What exactly will I get?" (need: clarity on the offer)

### Discern (What is the desired state?)

For each barrier you identified, write a content section that addresses it. Each section should follow the Observe / Discern / Validate pattern:

**Section format:**

> **Section heading:** [A statement or question that names the barrier]
>
> **Body (2-3 paragraphs):**
> - Paragraph 1 (Observe): Acknowledge their current experience. Use their language. Show you understand.
> - Paragraph 2 (Discern): Paint the alternative. What does the desired state look like?
> - Paragraph 3 (Validate): Provide evidence, a story, or a question that makes the alternative feel real.

Write 3-5 sections. Common landing page sections include:
- Problem statement (why the status quo is not working)
- Solution overview (what you offer, in outcome terms)
- How it works (the process, in three steps or fewer)
- Proof (testimonials, case studies, credentials)
- FAQ (addressing remaining objections)
- Final CTA (the ask, restated)

### Validate with a Question

Read your sections in order, from hero to final CTA. Ask yourself:

> **"If I were my target audience, would I feel seen by the first section, informed by the middle sections, and motivated by the final section?"**

If any section feels like it is about you rather than about them, rewrite it through the lens of their pain points map.

## Deliverable

**Content sections draft** -- 3-5 written sections for your landing page, each following the Observe / Discern / Validate structure.

These do not need to be polished. They need to be honest and structured. Phase 04 will turn them into a designed, deployed page.

Write them in your incubator journal or in a separate document. Include:
- Hero headline + CTA (from Lesson 7)
- 3-5 body sections
- Final CTA

## Key Takeaway

> "The variable name isn't the value. Telling is the variable name. Showing is the value it points to."

*Adapted from "Just Ask" by Pinghsien Wu, Chapter 8*

Your content sections are not telling your audience about your product. They are showing your audience their own situation -- and then showing them what becomes possible. The difference between telling and showing is the difference between a fifty-slide deck and a thirty-day pilot. Between a feature list and a conversation.

Show. Do not tell.
