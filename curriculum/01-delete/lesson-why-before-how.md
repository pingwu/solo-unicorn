# Lesson: Why Before How

**First Principles -- The Problem Behind the Problem**

## Opening Excerpt

> He did not open with a syllabus. He did not talk about Python. He walked to the whiteboard, uncapped a blue marker, and wrote five words in tiny, precise handwriting -- the kind drilled into you when writing on map overlays matters:
>
> **WHAT PROBLEM ARE YOU SOLVING?**
>
> Then he turned around and said nothing.

*From "Just Ask" by Pinghsien Wu, Chapter 3*

Adam Shaw -- former rocket scientist, author, martial arts champion, and Python instructor -- does not teach programming. He trains thinking. His classroom mantra is relentless: before you write a single line of code, before you build a single slide, before you start any project -- what problem are you solving?

> "Most people start here." He tapped TOOL. "They learn Python, or JavaScript, or whatever the internet told them to learn this week. Then they go looking for a problem to solve with it. That's backwards."

*From "Just Ask" by Pinghsien Wu, Chapter 3*

## The Concept: First Principles Thinking

A first principle is the smallest truth you cannot reduce further. It is bedrock. Everything else is built on top of those pieces. When you combine first principles in new ways, that is where innovation comes from -- not from memorizing syntax, not from copying templates, but from understanding the pieces so well you can rearrange them.

Adam teaches David a distinction that changes everything: **the symbol is not the referent.**

> "It's a symbol pointing to a referent. The symbol is `client_complaint`. The referent is whatever string actually gets stored there at runtime. Every bug you'll ever write comes from confusing the symbol with the referent."

*From "Just Ask" by Pinghsien Wu, Chapter 3*

This applies beyond code. "I need a landing page" is a symbol. The referent -- what you actually need -- might be clarity about your audience. "I need to learn AI" is a symbol. The referent might be "I need to stay relevant." The surface statement hides the deeper structure.

Adam then introduces the idea that becomes the novel's spine:

> "There are two NLPs. Natural Language Processing -- that's what the AI stuff uses. The other is Neuro-Linguistic Programming. Both are built on the same linguistic insight. Humans don't process reality directly. We delete, distort, and generalize. We take the infinite complexity of experience and compress it into something manageable."

*From "Just Ask" by Pinghsien Wu, Chapter 3*

## The Writitation Exercise

### Observe (What is the current state?)

You have completed two lessons. You have a list of expired assumptions and an identified lemon juice. Now step back and write for ten minutes:

> **What problem am I actually trying to solve by building a landing page?**

Write the obvious answer first. Then keep going. Push past "I want to generate leads" or "I want an online presence." Those are symbols. What is the referent? What is underneath?

Common patterns:
- "I want to be seen as an expert" -- referent: I feel invisible
- "I want to generate revenue" -- referent: I need to prove this is viable
- "I want to help people" -- referent: I want to matter

There is no wrong answer. There is only the surface answer and the deeper one.

### Discern (What is the desired state?)

Using what surfaced, write one sentence that names the **real problem** you are solving -- not the tool you want to build, but the human problem underneath it.

Format:

> **"The problem I am solving is: [audience] needs [outcome] because [reason], and nobody is providing it in a way that [specific gap]."**

Example: *"The problem I am solving is: mid-career professionals need to translate their existing expertise into AI-era relevance, because the frameworks that made them successful are expiring, and nobody is providing a bridge that respects what they already know."*

This is your **one-sentence problem statement**. It will anchor every decision in the rest of the curriculum.

### Validate with a Question

Turn your problem statement into a question you could ask a real person:

> **"Do you experience [the problem]? If so, what have you tried, and why didn't it work?"**

Write the question. Notice whether it makes you uncomfortable. Discomfort means you are close to the honest question.

---

## Deliverable

**A one-sentence problem statement** that names the real problem your landing page will address.

This statement should:
- Name a specific audience (not "everyone")
- Identify a real pain point (not a feature you want to build)
- Articulate the gap (what exists but does not work)

Write it in your incubator journal. Read it aloud. If it sounds like marketing copy, go deeper. If it sounds uncomfortably honest, you are probably there.

## Key Takeaway

> "You built a deletion filter. Your machine takes all the raw data of a situation and asks: what did I delete? What did I leave out? What did I not notice because my brain was already running a story?"

*From "Just Ask" by Pinghsien Wu, Chapter 3*

Adam's assessment of David's class project -- a tool that asks questions instead of giving answers -- captures the essence of Phase 01. You have been building your own deletion filter across three lessons. You identified what you deleted (expired assumptions), what you distorted (lemon juice), and now the question behind the question (why before how).

The ground is clear. Phase 02 begins the work of transformation.
