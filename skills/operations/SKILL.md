# Operations

## Core Principle

Operations is the system that turns strategy into execution. Good ops means the right people doing the right work with the right information at the right time.

## Hiring

### Job Descriptions — Lead with Outcomes

```
BAD: "Responsibilities: Manage social media accounts, create content,
     analyze metrics, coordinate with design team..."

GOOD: "In your first 90 days, you will:
  - Launch our content engine and publish 3x/week across 2 channels
  - Grow organic traffic from 5K to 15K monthly visitors
  - Build a repeatable process the team can run without you"
```

### Job Description Template

```
[Title] at [Company]

THE OPPORTUNITY
  [2-3 sentences: why this role exists and why it matters now]

WHAT YOU'LL ACCOMPLISH
  In 30 days: [First meaningful deliverable]
  In 90 days: [Key milestone that proves success]
  In 12 months: [The transformation you'll drive]

WHAT YOU BRING
  - [Skill/experience that directly maps to outcomes above]
  - [Skill/experience]
  - [Skill/experience]
  (List 4-6 max. Each must connect to an outcome.)

WHAT WE OFFER
  [Comp, equity, benefits — be specific, not vague]
```

### Interview Scorecards — Reduce Bias

```
Score each candidate 1-5 on predefined criteria BEFORE discussing.

| Criteria | Weight | Candidate A | Candidate B |
|----------|--------|-------------|-------------|
| [Relevant skill 1] | 30% | | |
| [Relevant skill 2] | 25% | | |
| [Culture/values fit] | 20% | | |
| [Growth potential] | 15% | | |
| [Communication] | 10% | | |

Rules:
- Score independently before group debrief
- Criteria set BEFORE interviews, not after
- Same questions for every candidate at each stage
- Assign an interview lead who ensures criteria adherence
```

## OKRs (Liz Wessel / Google Framework)

### OKR Structure

```
OBJECTIVE: Qualitative, inspiring, time-bound
  "Become the go-to solution for mid-market SaaS onboarding"

KEY RESULTS: Quantitative, measurable, verifiable
  KR1: Increase activation rate from 35% to 55%
  KR2: Reduce time-to-first-value from 3 days to 4 hours
  KR3: Achieve NPS of 50+ from customers onboarded this quarter
```

### OKR Rules

```
1. 3-5 objectives per quarter (company-wide)
2. 2-4 key results per objective
3. Key results are outcomes, not tasks
   BAD KR: "Launch new onboarding flow"
   GOOD KR: "60% of new users complete onboarding in first session"
4. Score 0.0-1.0 at end of quarter
   0.7 = target (stretch goals should be hard)
   1.0 = you set the bar too low
5. OKRs are NOT performance reviews — they're alignment tools
```

### Cascade Pattern

```
Company OKR: "Win the mid-market"
  ↓
Product OKR: "Make onboarding effortless for teams of 10-50"
  ↓
Engineering OKR: "Ship self-serve onboarding with <2 min setup time"
  ↓
Individual OKR: "Build team invitation flow with SSO integration"
```

### Quarterly OKR Cadence

```
Week -2:  Leadership drafts company OKRs
Week -1:  Teams propose team OKRs aligned to company goals
Week 0:   Lock OKRs, communicate widely
Week 3:   First check-in — are we on track?
Week 6:   Mid-quarter review — adjust tactics, not goals
Week 12:  Score, reflect, set next quarter
```

## Board Management

### Board Deck Template (Lead with Asks)

```
Slide 1: ASKS (yes, first)
  "We need [decision/resource]. Here's why."
  Put asks first so the board spends time on what matters.

Slide 2: KPI Dashboard
  5-7 metrics with trend arrows. Red/yellow/green.
  Revenue, burn, runway, key product metrics.

Slide 3: Wins & Learnings
  Top 3 wins. Top 3 things that didn't work and what you learned.

Slide 4: Product Update
  What shipped, what's next, key decisions.

Slide 5: Team & Org
  Key hires, departures, org changes.

Slide 6: Financial Summary
  Actual vs. plan. Burn rate. Runway.

Slide 7: Roadmap
  Next quarter priorities.
```

### Investor Update Email (Monthly)

```
Subject: [Company] — [Month] Update

TL;DR: [One sentence summary: good news + challenge]

ASKS:
  - [Specific ask #1 — intro, advice, resource]
  - [Specific ask #2]

KEY METRICS:
  MRR: $X (+Y% MoM)
  Customers: X (+Y)
  Burn: $X/mo | Runway: X months

WINS:
  - [Win 1]
  - [Win 2]

CHALLENGES:
  - [Challenge + what you're doing about it]

NEXT MONTH:
  - [Priority 1]
  - [Priority 2]
```

## Internal Communications

Clear internal communication is an operations function. Use these templates for recurring updates across your team or company.

### 3P Updates (Progress, Plans, Problems)

For weekly team updates. Readable in 30-60 seconds. Data-driven, not prose-heavy.

```
[emoji] [Team Name] (Week of [dates])

Progress: [1-3 sentences — what shipped, milestones hit, metrics moved]
Plans: [1-3 sentences — top priorities for next week]
Problems: [1-3 sentences — blockers, resource gaps, risks]

RULES:
  → Score each on granularity: bigger team = bigger items
  → Include metrics where possible
  → Matter-of-fact tone — save storytelling for newsletters
```

### Company Newsletter

For weekly or monthly company-wide updates. 20-25 bullet points. Sent via Slack and email.

```
Structure by area (not by team):
  :megaphone: Company Announcements
  :dart: Progress on Priorities
  :pillar: Leadership Updates
  :thread: External & Social

RULES:
  → Each bullet: 1-2 sentences max
  → Use "we" tense — you are part of the company
  → Link to source documents, Slack threads, press mentions
  → Focus on company-wide impact, not team-specific details
  → Highlight wins AND challenges honestly
```

### FAQ Responses

Compile frequently asked questions across the company. Minimize confusion, keep everyone aligned.

```
Format:
  - *Question*: [1 sentence — the real question people are asking]
  - *Answer*: [1-2 sentences — clear, sourced, actionable]

RULES:
  → Base answers on official communications when possible
  → If uncertain, say so — don't fabricate certainty
  → Link to authoritative sources (docs, announcements)
  → Focus on questions that affect a large portion of the team
  → Cover: corporate events, launches, hiring, vision changes
```

### Status Reports and Project Updates

```
PROJECT UPDATE: [Project Name] — [Date]

STATUS: [On Track / At Risk / Blocked] [green/yellow/red]

SUMMARY: [2-3 sentences — current state and trajectory]

KEY MILESTONES:
  - [x] [Completed milestone]
  - [ ] [Next milestone — target date]

DECISIONS NEEDED:
  - [Decision — who needs to decide, by when]

RISKS:
  - [Risk — likelihood, impact, mitigation]
```

### Incident Reports

```
INCIDENT: [Brief title]
SEVERITY: [P0/P1/P2/P3]
DURATION: [Start time — End time / Ongoing]

WHAT HAPPENED: [2-3 sentences — factual description]
IMPACT: [Who was affected, how many, what was broken]
ROOT CAUSE: [What caused it — known or under investigation]
RESOLUTION: [What was done to fix it]
FOLLOW-UPS:
  - [ ] [Action item — owner — due date]
```

## Anti-Patterns

| Ops Theater | Real Operations |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Job desc listing 15 requirements | 4-6 requirements tied to outcomes |
| "Culture fit" without definition | Scorecard with predefined criteria |
| OKRs that are task lists | OKRs that are outcome measures |
| Board deck that buries the ask on slide 10 | Ask on slide 1 |
| Monthly updates that hide bad news | Leading with challenges and what you're doing |

## Power Move

"Help me write an outcome-based job description for [role], design a 4-stage interview process with scorecards, and draft OKRs for their first quarter. Then create a board deck template with my asks front and center."

The agent becomes your COO — building the operating system that makes the company run.
