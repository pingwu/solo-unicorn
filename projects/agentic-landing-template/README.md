# Agentic Landing Page Template

> **"When AI can do anything for you, what will you build?"**

A production-ready landing page template that teaches AI-assisted cloud development. Go from `git clone` to a live deployed site using natural language prompts and container commands.

## Quick Start

**Prerequisites:** [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/), [Git](https://git-scm.com/), and an AI coding assistant ([Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) or [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli)).

> **Zero host installation:** You do NOT need Node.js, npm, or any other dev tools on your machine. Everything runs inside the Docker container.

**Tell your AI agent:**
```
"Clone the agentic-landing-template repo, start the dev container, and open localhost:3000"
```

Then customize with natural language:
```
"Update the hero section with my name 'Your Name' and title 'Your Title'"
```

**CLI Reference:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pingwu/agentic-landing-template.git
cd agentic-landing-template
npm run docker:dev
# Open http://localhost:3000
```
