# AGENTS.md — Unicorn Project Agent Constitution

Agent behavioral rules for the Unicorn Project. This file is for AI coding agents only.

## 1. Head/Hand Architecture

- `knowledge/` is **read-only context**. Never modify files here. Use it to inform decisions.
- `projects/` is where **code changes happen**. All implementation work targets a sub-project.
- `skills/` contains agent-agnostic prompting patterns. Read them; do not modify them.
- `curriculum/` is student-facing content. Agents may edit when explicitly instructed.

## 2. Software Creation Rules

- **TDD**: Write tests before implementation. Validate requirements through tests.
- **BDD**: Define behavior specs that align development with user needs.
- **MVP**: Build the simplest version that proves the concept. No speculative features.
- **Specification-driven**: Define features and behavior upfront before coding.

## 3. Office Structure — Role-to-Skill Mapping

The project uses an "Office" metaphor. Each role maps to agent skills in `skills/`.

| Office | Role | Associated Skills |
|--------|------|-------------------|
| CEO | Root orchestrator | All skills as needed |
| CFO | Financial / cost analysis | `aws-cli-architect` |
| CTO | Tech architecture & dev | `aws-cli-architect`, `multi-file-architecture`, `test-driven-scaffolding`, `git-expert`, `github-cli` |
| CSO | Security | `context-aware-debugging` |
| CMO | Marketing & branding | `pm-design-thinking`, `multi-file-architecture`, `context-aware-debugging` |
| CRO | Revenue & sales | `pm-design-thinking` |
| CPO | Product definition | `pm-design-thinking`, `test-driven-scaffolding` |
| CCO | Customer experience | `pm-design-thinking`, `multi-file-architecture` |

## 4. Post-Clone Setup

### 4.1. Create Agent Skill Symlinks

**Natural Language (Recommended)**:
```
"Set up the agent skill symlinks for .gemini and .claude directories"
```

**CLI Reference (macOS / Linux)**:
```bash
ln -s ../../skills .gemini/skills
mkdir -p .claude && ln -s ../skills .claude/skills
```

**CLI Reference (Windows PowerShell as Admin)**:
```powershell
cmd /c mklink /D .gemini\skills ..\..\skills
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path .claude
cmd /c mklink /D .claude\skills ..\skills
```

Verify: `ls .gemini/skills/` and `ls .claude/skills/`

### 4.2. Start the Dev Container

All dev tools live inside the container. **Never install tools or npm packages on the host.**

**Natural Language (Recommended)**:
```
"Start the dev container for the agentic-landing-template project"
```

**CLI Reference**:
```bash
cd projects/agentic-landing-template
npm run docker:dev
```

Use the container for all commands:
```bash
npm run docker:shell
docker compose run --rm --no-deps dev sh -c "<command>"
```

## 5. Development Workflow

### Container Commands

| Natural Language | CLI Command | Purpose |
|-----------------|-------------|---------|
| "Start the dev server" | `npm run docker:dev` | Start dev server (port 3000) |
| "Open a shell in the container" | `npm run docker:shell` | Shell into running container |
| "Stop the containers" | `npm run docker:down` | Stop containers |
| "Start a production preview" | `npm run docker:prod` | Production preview (port 3001) |
| "Show the container logs" | `npm run docker:logs` | View logs |
| "Check container status" | `npm run docker:status` | Check container status |
| "Clean up containers and volumes" | `npm run docker:clean` | Remove containers and volumes |

### Quality Commands (inside container)

| Natural Language | CLI Command |
|-----------------|-------------|
| "Run all tests" | `npx vitest run` |
| "Lint the code" | `npm run lint` |
| "Type-check the project" | `npx tsc --noEmit` |

### One-Off Container Commands

```bash
docker compose run --rm --no-deps dev sh -c "npx vitest run"
docker compose run --rm --no-deps dev sh -c "npm install -D <package>"
docker compose run --rm --no-deps dev sh -c "gh pr list"
```

## 6. Coding Conventions

- **TypeScript**: Strict mode, ES2022, explicit types. Path alias `@/*` maps to project root.
- **React/Next.js**: Server Components by default. `'use client'` only when necessary. Preserve accessibility.
- **Tailwind CSS 4**: Utility classes, dark mode compatible.
- **Docker**: Always detached mode (`-d`) for container startup.
- **Container-first installs**: Never install npm packages on the host. Use `docker compose run --rm --no-deps dev sh -c "npm install -D <package>"`.

## 7. Project Structure

```
/unicorn/
├── .claude/skills/     → skills/ (symlink)
├── .gemini/skills/     → skills/ (symlink)
├── .obsidian/          Obsidian vault config
├── curriculum/         Student-facing learning content
├── knowledge/          READ-ONLY: PKM vault (Obsidian)

├── CLAUDE.md           Claude Code prompt
├── GEMINI.md           Gemini CLI prompt
└── LICENSE
```

## 8. Troubleshooting

- **Build failures**: Check error messages, verify Node.js version in container, check dependencies.
- **`next build` fails with "Cannot find module 'typescript'"**: The builder stage needs ALL dependencies (`npm ci`), not just production deps. `next.config.ts` requires TypeScript at build time.
- **Dockerfile COPY fails on missing directory**: Docker `COPY` fails hard if the source doesn't exist. Use a glob pattern (e.g., `publi[c]`) to make the copy optional.
- **Cloud Run / App Runner rejects image**: Cloud services require `linux/amd64`. On Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3), build with `docker build --platform linux/amd64`.
- **Always test `npm run docker:prod` locally** before pushing to any cloud registry. This catches build and runtime errors before they cost time in the deployment pipeline.
- **Deployment issues**: Verify Docker image compatibility, cloud service configs, IAM permissions.
- **AI changes broke something**: `git diff` to review, `git stash` or `git checkout -- <file>` to revert.

## 9. Container-First Development (Mandatory)

Development MUST mirror the production environment from day one. All code execution, dependency installation, builds, and tests happen inside Docker containers.

**Permitted on the host**: Docker Desktop, Git, AI coding agents (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, etc.), and text editors/IDEs.

**Prohibited on the host**: `npm install`, `npm run dev`, `npm run build`, `npx`, or any Node.js execution. If you need a new tool to develop the application, add it to `Dockerfile.dev` — never install it on the host. If you need to run a command, run it inside the container:

```bash
# WRONG — host execution
npm install
npm run dev
npm run build

# RIGHT — container execution
npm run docker:dev                                           # dev server
npm run docker:shell                                         # interactive shell
docker compose run --rm --no-deps dev sh -c "npm run build"  # one-off command
docker compose run --rm --no-deps dev sh -c "npm install -D <package>"
```

This constraint ensures every developer, from day one, works in the same environment that runs in production. No "works on my machine" surprises.

## 10. Additional Constraints

- Do not modify files in `knowledge/` unless explicitly instructed.
- Do not run containers in foreground mode; always use `-d`.
- Do not skip tests. Run `npx vitest run` (inside the container) before committing changes.
- Do not create files outside the project structure without explicit instruction.

## 11. Security Rules

### Secrets and Credentials
- **Never** hardcode API keys, passwords, or tokens in source files.
- Use environment variables for all sensitive configuration.
- Ensure `.env` files are listed in `.gitignore` — never commit them.
- Never log secrets or include them in error messages.

### Command Execution
- Shell command arguments (e.g., `<package>` in `npm install -D <package>`) must use exact, validated values — never interpolate unsanitized user input.
- Use the predefined npm scripts (e.g., `npm run docker:dev`) rather than constructing shell commands dynamically.
- Before running any command that modifies files or installs packages, verify the source is trusted.

### Input Validation
- Natural language to CLI mappings must use exact, predefined commands only.
- Do not dynamically construct shell commands from user-provided strings.
- Validate package names against npm registry before installation.

### File Access
- Agents should only modify files within the project directory they're assigned to.
- Verify symlink targets exist and contain expected content before following them.
- Do not access files outside the repository root without explicit user instruction.
