# AI Coding Agents: Complete Comparison Guide

**For builders who want AI as a real development partner**

---

## Why CLI Coding Agents?

The magic of a CLI coding agent is its ability to **translate natural language into system command-line interface (CLI) commands** — and execute them.

You say: *"Set up a Docker container with Node 20, install dependencies, and start the dev server."*

The agent translates that into `docker compose up -d`, `npm install`, `npm run dev` — and runs it. No copy-pasting. No switching between a chat window and a terminal. The AI reads your project, understands the context, and operates your machine.

This is why **Solo Unicorn Builder prefers CLI coding agents**. They don't just suggest code — they execute workflows. They read your `SKILL.md` files, understand your project structure, run tests, manage Git, deploy containers, and orchestrate multi-file changes. All from natural language.

**IDE-based agents** (Copilot, Cursor) are great for real-time autocomplete while typing. But CLI agents are where AI becomes a true **operating partner** — not just a suggestion engine.

---

## What is an AI Coding Agent?

Think of an AI coding agent as a **smart assistant that helps you write, edit, and understand code**. Unlike traditional tools that just highlight syntax or check for errors, AI coding agents:

- **Understand what you're trying to build** (not just what you've written)
- **Suggest entire functions or files** (not just the next line)
- **Explain complex code in plain English** (or write code from your English description)
- **Execute system commands** from natural language instructions
- **Refactor across multiple files** (understanding your whole project)

**For non-coders:** Imagine having a translator who not only translates words but understands the context, suggests better phrasing, and can rewrite entire paragraphs to be clearer. That's what AI coding agents do for software.

**For coders:** It's like pair programming with a senior developer who's read your entire codebase and can suggest refactorings, catch bugs, write tests, and explain architectural decisions — and who can also run the commands for you.

## IDE Agents (Complementary)

These agents live inside your editor. Great for real-time autocomplete and inline edits, but they don't execute commands.

| Agent | Type | Installation | Key Strength |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Cursor** | AI-powered IDE | Download from [cursor.com](https://cursor.com) | **Complete AI editor.** VS Code fork with chat, multi-file editing, Cmd+K inline edits. |
| **GitHub Copilot** | IDE extension | VS Code / JetBrains extension | **Real-time autocomplete.** Best for day-to-day typing productivity. |
| **Kiro IDE** | AI-powered IDE | Download from [kiro.dev](https://kiro.dev) | **Spec-first development.** Generates requirements and design docs before code. VS Code fork. |
| **Tabnine** | IDE extension | IDE extension — [tabnine.com](https://www.tabnine.com) | **On-premise options.** Code stays private, enterprise compliance. |

**Tip:** Use a CLI agent as your primary development partner and an IDE agent for real-time autocomplete. They complement each other.

## Choosing Your Agent(s)

### Decision Framework

1. **What's your primary use case?**
   - Complex architecture and refactoring → **Claude Code**
   - Large codebases, multimodal → **Gemini CLI**
   - AWS infrastructure and DevOps → **Kiro CLI**
   - Maximum model flexibility → **OpenCode**
   - Minimal, hackable, self-owned → **Pi**
   - Real-time autocomplete → **Copilot** or **Cursor** (IDE)

2. **What's your budget?**
   - Pay per use → Claude Code, Gemini CLI
   - Monthly subscription → Kiro CLI ($0-200), Copilot ($10-20), Cursor ($20)
   - Free/open source → OpenCode (but you pay for LLM API, or use local models)

3. **What cloud do you use?**
   - AWS → Kiro CLI
   - GCP → Gemini CLI
   - Any/none → Claude Code or OpenCode

### Recommended for Solo Unicorn Builder

**Primary:** Pick one CLI agent — Claude Code, Gemini CLI, or Kiro CLI
**Optional:** Add Cursor or Copilot for real-time autocomplete in your IDE

All of Solo Unicorn Builder's skills work with any CLI agent. You describe what you need in natural language, the agent reads the relevant `SKILL.md`, and executes.

---

## The Multi-Agent Workflow

**Best practice:** Use multiple CLI agents for different strengths.

### Example: Building and Deploying a Feature

```
1. Claude Code: "Analyze the codebase and design an OAuth integration"
   → Architectural plan, multi-file changes

2. Kiro CLI: "Deploy this to AWS with a staging environment"
   → Infrastructure setup, container registry, Cloud Run config

3. Gemini CLI: "Generate comprehensive API documentation from the codebase"
   → Large context window handles the full system

4. Claude Code: "Review the PR for security issues before merge"
   → Detailed code review with reasoning
```

Each agent does what it does best. Your job is to ask the right questions.

---

## Common Questions

**Q: Will AI replace developers?**
**A:** No. AI makes developers more productive, but humans still define requirements, make architectural decisions, review suggestions, and handle business logic.

**Q: Which agent should I learn first?**
**A:** Pick one CLI agent and start building. Skills transfer between agents. For Solo Unicorn Builder, Claude Code or Gemini CLI are the most common starting points.

**Q: What happened to Amazon CodeWhisperer?**
**A:** AWS retired CodeWhisperer in April 2024 and merged its features into Amazon Q Developer. Kiro is AWS's newer, more ambitious offering — a spec-first AI development platform available as both an IDE and a CLI.

**Q: Are these tools ready for production?**
**A:** Yes, with caveats: always review AI-generated code, use tests to catch issues, and start with well-understood problems.

**Q: What about code privacy?**
**A:** Varies by tool:
- **Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Kiro CLI:** Code sent to cloud for processing
- **OpenCode:** Can use local LLMs for full privacy
- Check each tool's privacy policy for your compliance needs
