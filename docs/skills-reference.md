## How Skills Work

Each skill lives in `skills/` as a folder with a `SKILL.md` file. When you ask your AI agent for help with a task, it reads the relevant skill and applies that expertise to your situation.

You don't need to memorize skill names. Just describe what you need:
- "Help me write a resume for this job posting" → uses `career-resume`
- "Set up my GitHub profile README" → uses `github-profile`
- "I have a Python dependency conflict with torch and numpy" → uses `python-dependency-expert`
- "Help me contribute to an open-source project" → uses `open-source-contribution`
- "Help me find my first clients" → uses `go-to-market` and `sales`
- "Make this page work better on mobile" → uses `frontend-ui-ux`
- "Write tests before I build this feature" → uses `test-first-development`
- "Build an MCP server for the GitHub API" → uses `mcp-builder`
- "Write Playwright tests for my web app" → uses `webapp-testing`
- "Create a pitch deck as a PowerPoint" → uses `document-creation`
- "Create generative art inspired by ocean waves" → uses `generative-art`
- "Help me create a new skill for database management" → uses `skill-creator`

The AI figures out which skill to use based on what you ask.
